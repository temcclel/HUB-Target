# Hi!
This is the README file for the HUB-Target project, Good luck Rocky! I hope that our efforts can help out!

## Versioning Explaination

Simply put, the first of the two numbers is the hardware model it is designed for, and the second is the software release.

For example, if you were looking for the V3 software release for the V2 system, 
**it would look like V2.3**

You might also see a third number, these are for small patches, and improvements, eg. 
**V2.3.2**
